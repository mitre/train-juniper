# Session Summary - June 22, 2025 Evening

## Context: 8% remaining

### Major Accomplishments

#### 1. Fixed Environment Variable Bug
- **Issue**: Empty environment variables were overriding CLI flags
- **Solution**: Created `env_value()` helper that treats empty strings as nil
- **Impact**: CLI flags now work correctly even with empty env vars set

#### 2. DRY Refactoring - Phase 1 Complete
- Created `JuniperTestHelpers` module with:
  - `clean_juniper_env` for environment cleanup
  - `default_mock_options` and `bastion_mock_options` helpers
- Refactored mock responses to configuration hash
- Improved SSH options building with declarative mapping
- Extracted common version detection pattern (90.63% coverage achieved)

#### 3. Security Enhancements Added
- **Command Sanitization**: Prevents injection attacks while allowing pipe (|) for JunOS
- **Input Validation**: Validates host, user, ports (1-65535), positive timeouts
- **Safe Logging**: Redacts sensitive data (passwords, keys, proxy commands)
- **Health Check**: Added `healthy?` method for connection monitoring

#### 4. Test Coverage
- Added comprehensive security tests (12 new test cases)
- Coverage: 89.74% (280/312) - slight drop due to new edge cases
- All 151 tests passing

### Code Changes Summary
```
- Bug fix: Empty env vars no longer override CLI flags
- Bastion defaults: bastion_user ‚Üí main user, bastion_password ‚Üí main password
- DRY improvements: ~200 lines of duplicate code removed
- Security: Command sanitization, input validation, safe logging
- New features: healthy? method, better error messages
```

### Pending Tasks (from TODO)
1. ‚úÖ Add command sanitization for security
2. ‚è≥ Extract mock responses to separate module
3. ‚úÖ Add input validation for connection options
4. ‚è≥ Break down long connect method
5. üîÑ Add YARD documentation to public methods (started)
6. ‚úÖ Add tests for security features

### Next Session Priorities
1. Complete YARD documentation for all public methods
2. Break down the long `connect` method into smaller methods
3. Extract mock responses to a separate module
4. Update version to 0.6.3 for patch release
5. Prepare for gem publication

### Key Files Modified
- `lib/train-juniper/connection.rb` - Main security and validation changes
- `lib/train-juniper/platform.rb` - Regex fixes for warnings
- `test/helper.rb` - JuniperTestHelpers module
- `test/unit/connection_test.rb` - New security tests
- Multiple test files updated to use helpers

### Important Notes
- The pipe character (|) is allowed in commands as it's common in JunOS
- Port validation accepts strings and converts to integers
- All RuboCop violations have been resolved
- README was updated with new bastion defaults documentation
