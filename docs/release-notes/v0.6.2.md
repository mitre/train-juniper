# Release Notes for v0.6.2

Released: 2025-06-18

## What's Changed

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Windows Installation**: Fixed FFI dependency issue preventing Windows users from installing the gem. Updated dependency to match InSpec 7's FFI version range (>= 1.15.5, < 1.17.0) which includes precompiled Windows binaries. (Fixes #2)

- **Mock Mode Platform Detection**: Fixed issue where mock mode was returning the gem version instead of the mocked JunOS version (12.1X47-D15.4). Added missing `mock?` method and updated `connected?` to properly handle mock mode.

### 🚀 Improvements

- **Trusted Publishing**: Updated release workflow to use RubyGems trusted publishing with OIDC authentication, eliminating the need for API keys in CI/CD.

- **Ruby 3.3 Support**: Updated all workflows to use Ruby 3.3 for better trusted publishing support and latest security features.

### 📚 Documentation

- Added comprehensive mock mode documentation with correct usage examples
- Updated release process documentation to reflect trusted publishing setup
