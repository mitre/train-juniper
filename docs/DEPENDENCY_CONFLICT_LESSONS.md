# Train Plugin Dependency Conflict Resolution - Lessons Learned

## Overview

This document captures critical lessons learned while debugging gem dependency conflicts in Train plugins, specifically focusing on net-ssh version conflicts and InSpec plugin manager issues.

## Problem Summary

During development of the train-juniper plugin, we encountered several related issues:

1. **Net-SSH Version Conflicts**: "already initialized constant" warnings 
2. **InSpec Plugin Manager Crashes**: NoMethodError on nil.version
3. **Platform Families Bug**: InSpec showing incorrect families causing resource failures

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Net-SSH Version Conflicts
**Symptoms:**
```
/Users/user/.rvm/gems/ruby-3.1.6/gems/net-ssh-7.3.0/lib/net/ssh/version.rb:49: warning: already initialized constant Net::SSH::Version::MAJOR
/Users/user/.inspec/gems/3.1.0/gems/net-ssh-7.3.0/lib/net/ssh/version.rb:49: warning: previous definition of MAJOR was here
```

**Root Cause:** 
- InSpec has isolated gem directory: `~/.inspec/gems/3.1.0/`
- System gems also loaded from: `~/.rvm/gems/ruby-3.1.6/gems/`
- Same net-ssh version (7.3.0) loaded from two different sources
- Ruby loads both, causing constant redefinition warnings

**Solution Pattern:**
```ruby
# In gemspec - match train-core's exact version range
spec.add_dependency "net-ssh", ">= 2.9", "< 8.0"  # NOT "~> 7.0"
```

### Issue 2: InSpec Plugin Manager Crashes
**Symptoms:**
```
undefined method `version' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)
at cli_command.rb:516 in `make_pretty_version'
```

**Root Cause:** InSpec's plugin manager bug (PR #7259)
```ruby
# InSpec's broken code pattern:
gems.select { |spec| spec.name == plugin_name }  # Returns empty array when gem not found
    .max_by(&:version)                           # max_by on empty = nil  
    .version                                     # .version on nil = CRASH!
```

**Impact:** Version number changes can trigger this bug unpredictably

### Issue 3: Platform Families Bug  
**Symptoms:**
```
# InSpec shell showing incorrect families:
Families: network          # WRONG - causes InSpec resource failures
# Should show:
Families: bsd, unix, os    # CORRECT - enables InSpec resources
```

**Root Cause:** Unknown - something was setting `@platform[:families] = "network"`

**Solution:** Following train-core dependency patterns exactly fixed this

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Dependency Version Range Strategy
```ruby
# OLD APPROACH - Too narrow, causes conflicts:
spec.add_dependency "net-ssh", "~> 7.0"

# NEW APPROACH - Match train-core exactly:
spec.add_dependency "train-core", "~> 3.12.13"
spec.add_dependency "net-ssh", ">= 2.9", "< 8.0"  # Same as train-core
spec.add_dependency "ffi", "~> 1.16.0"            # InSpec compatibility
```

### 2. Defensive Require Statements
```ruby
# Prevent double-loading conflicts
require 'net/ssh' unless defined?(Net::SSH) && Net::SSH.respond_to?(:start)
require 'net/ssh/proxy/jump' unless defined?(Net::SSH::Proxy::Jump)
```

**Critical Learning:** Check for both constant existence AND required methods

### 3. Official Train Plugin Patterns
**Study these official patterns:**

**train-core.gemspec** (Base pattern):
```ruby
spec.add_dependency "net-ssh", ">= 2.9", "< 8.0"  # Wide range
spec.add_dependency "ffi", "~> 1.16.0"            # Specific constraint
```

**train-habitat.gemspec** (Minimal pattern):
```ruby
# NO net-ssh dependency - let train-core handle it completely
```

**train-kubernetes.gemspec** (Community pattern):
```ruby
spec.add_dependency 'train', '~> 3.0'  # Full train instead of train-core
```

## Results Achieved

### ✅ Fixed Issues:
1. **InSpec plugin list works** - No more version detection crashes
2. **Platform families correct** - Shows `bsd, unix, os` enabling InSpec resources  
3. **Plugin stability** - Works across version changes
4. **SSH connectivity** - Defensive loading prevents method errors

### ⚠️ Remaining Cosmetic Issues:
1. **Net-SSH warnings persist** - Harmless, will be fixed in InSpec 7
2. **FFI git repository errors** - InSpec internal issue, safe to ignore

## Best Practices for Train Plugin Development

### 1. Dependency Management
```ruby
# RECOMMENDED: Match train-core patterns exactly
spec.add_dependency "train-core", "~> 3.12.13"
spec.add_dependency "net-ssh", ">= 2.9", "< 8.0"  # Wide range like train-core
spec.add_dependency "ffi", "~> 1.16.0"            # InSpec compatibility fix

# AVOID: Narrow version constraints that conflict with train-core
spec.add_dependency "net-ssh", "~> 7.0"  # Too narrow
```

### 2. Defensive Programming
```ruby
# Check for both constant and required functionality
require 'gem' unless defined?(Gem) && Gem.respond_to?(:required_method)

# NOT just constant existence (incomplete loading):
require 'gem' unless defined?(Gem)  # Can cause missing methods
```

### 3. Version Testing Strategy
- Test with multiple version numbers (0.1.0, 0.2.0, 0.2.1, 0.3.0)
- Some versions trigger InSpec plugin manager bugs unpredictably
- Wide dependency ranges provide more stability

### 4. InSpec Compatibility Debugging
```bash
# Use debug logging to understand plugin loading:
inspec plugin install plugin.gem -l debug

# Test plugin list after installation:
inspec plugin list

# Verify platform detection:
inspec shell -t transport://
```

## Known InSpec Issues

### 1. Plugin Manager Bug (PR #7259)
- **Fixed in:** InSpec 7 (not yet released)
- **Current version:** InSpec 6.8.24 has the bug
- **Workaround:** Use wide dependency ranges, avoid narrow constraints

### 2. FFI Git Repository Errors
- **Symptoms:** `fatal: not a git repository: 'ext/ffi_c/libffi/.git'`
- **Impact:** Cosmetic warnings only, no functional impact
- **Fix:** Will be addressed in future InSpec release

### 3. Gem Loading Conflicts
- **Root cause:** Dual gem paths (system vs InSpec managed)
- **Mitigation:** Match train-core dependency patterns exactly

## Integration Points for Tutorial Modules

- Explain relationship between families and InSpec resource compatibility
- Show how `bsd → unix → os` hierarchy enables `command` and `os` resources

### Module 11: Troubleshooting

- Distinguish between harmless warnings and real errors

### New Module: Production Deployment

## Conclusion

The key insight is that **Train plugin stability comes from matching official patterns exactly** rather than trying to innovate on dependency management. The Train ecosystem has established patterns that work - deviation leads to conflicts and crashes.

**Most importantly:** What appear to be complex technical issues often resolve by simply following train-core's dependency patterns precisely.
