name: Documentation

# This workflow automatically builds and deploys documentation
# - On every push to main (including docs-only changes)
# - On pull requests (build only, no deploy)
# - Manual trigger via workflow_dispatch
#
# To update docs without releasing gem:
# 1. Make documentation changes
# 2. Commit with message like "docs: update installation guide"
# 3. Push to main - docs will auto-deploy to GitHub Pages
