## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| 0.1.x   | âœ… Yes    |

## Security Testing

The plugin includes comprehensive security testing:

```bash
# Run security test suite
bundle exec ruby test/security/security_test.rb

# Check for vulnerable dependencies
bundle exec bundle-audit check

# Scan for potential security issues
bundle exec brakeman --no-pager
```

## Known Security Considerations

### Network Device Access
- Train-Juniper requires SSH access to network infrastructure
- Ensure proper network segmentation and access controls
- Use dedicated service accounts with minimal required privileges

### Credential Management
- Plugin supports environment variables for credential management
- Consider using secrets management systems in production
- Rotate credentials regularly

### Logging and Debugging
- Debug mode may log sensitive command outputs
- Review log files for credential exposure
- Use `-l debug` sparingly in production environments
